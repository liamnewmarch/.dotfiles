# This file contains shell agnostic customisations. It is designed
# to be read by Zsh, Bash and Bourne shell (sh) so shell specific
# syntax shoud be avoided!
#
# The customisations themselves can be found in ~/.profile.d/
#
# Bash customisations can be found in ~/.bashrc
# Zsh customisations can be found in ~/.zshrc
#
# To enable a script, add it to the list below. Scripts should be
# added alphabetically except where necessary (e.g. the two override
# scripts `platform` and `local`) and should work independentally of
# one another where possible (scripts depending on `color` being a
# notable exception).
